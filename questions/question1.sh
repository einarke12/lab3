$q. Model the problem as a CSP, that is define variables, their domains
and constraints between them. There are different ways of modelling this.
Typically you want to have fewer variables and smaller domains (to reduce
the size of the state space) and fewer or simpler constraints (to speed up
constraint propagation). What are your variables and their domains?

There is no need to write down all the constraints here, if you have them
all in the implementation.
